# About
This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.

Alternatively, look at the find man page.

To access this level, log in as level00 with the password of level00.

# Exploitation
```bash
level00@nebula:~$ find / -perm -4000 -user flag00 2>/dev/null
/bin/.../flag00
/rofs/bin/.../flag00
level00@nebula:~$ 
```
The `perm -4000` option is to find Set User ID Program and `user flag00` option is to find program whose user is flag00.

To avoid stderr, I used `2>/dev/null` which means `2` is stderr, and `>/dev/null` is to avoid them.
